## Config.ini

`config.ini` is the configuration file that controls how a `nodeos` instance will function. For instance, within the `config.ini` you can specify:

* which nodes your node will peer with
* the actual plugins your node will use
* plugin-specific options to customize your node

Therefore, the `config.ini` file has a direct impact on the operation of the node. Most node operators edit and customize this file to assign specific roles to their nodes.

> ℹ️ `nodeos` can be configured using either command-line interface (CLI) options, the `config.ini` file, or both. Nodeos-specific options, on the other hand, can only be specified through the command line. To view all available CLI options and `config.ini` options, launch "nodeos --help" from a terminal.

### CLI options vs. `config.ini`

Every option from the `config.ini` file can also be specified as a CLI option. For instance, the `plugin = arg` option in `config.ini` can also be passed via the `--plugin arg` CLI option. However, the reverse is not always true: not every CLI option has an equivalent entry in the `config.ini` file. For instance, plugin-specific options that perform an immediate operation, like `--delete-state-history` from the `state_history_plugin`, cannot be specified in the `config.ini` file.

> ℹ️ Most node operators prefer `config.ini` options over CLI options. This is because the `config.ini` will preserve the configuration state, unlike CLI options specified when launching `nodeos`.

### Custom `config.ini`

To use a custom `config.ini` file, specify its filename by passing the `--config arg` option when launching `nodeos`. The custom filename is relative to the actual path of the `config.ini` file specified in the `--config-dir arg` option.

### Sample `config.ini`

<summary>Here is a simple example with common values provided:</summary>

```
# Specify the Access-Control-Allow-Origin to be returned on each request (eosio::http_plugin)
access-control-allow-origin = *

# The name supplied to identify this node amongst the peers. (eosio::net_plugin)
agent-name = "EOS Test Agent"

# Enable block production, even if the chain is stale. (eosio::producer_plugin)
enable-stale-production = true

# ID of producer controlled by this node (e.g. inita; may specify multiple times) (eosio::producer_plugin)
producer-name = eosio

# Key=Value pairs in the form <public-key>=<provider-spec>
# Where:
#    <public-key>    	is a string form of a vaild EOSIO public key
# 
#    <provider-spec> 	is a string in the form <provider-type>:<data>
# 
#    <provider-type> 	is KEY, KEOSD, or SE
# 
#    KEY:<data>      	is a string form of a valid EOSIO private key which maps to the provided public key
# 
#    KEOSD:<data>    	is the URL where keosd is available and the approptiate wallet(s) are unlocked
# 
#  (eosio::producer_plugin)
signature-provider = EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV=KEY:5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3

# Use to indicate that the RPC responses will not use ABIs.
# Failure to specify this option when there are no trace-rpc-abi configuations will result in an Error.
# This option is mutually exclusive with trace-rpc-api (eosio::trace_api_plugin)
trace-no-abis = true

# Plugin(s) to enable, may be specified multiple times
plugin = eosio::producer_plugin
plugin = eosio::producer_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::chain_plugin
plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::http_plugin
plugin = eosio::state_history_plugin
plugin = eosio::net_plugin
plugin = eosio::net_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::trace_api_plugin
```

## Plugins

This section covers the most common plugin options that affect node behavior. These options are always plugin-specific. This is true for a node configured to operate as a producing node, relay node, API node, etc.

> ℹ️ The following plugins are enabled by default when `nodeos` is launched: `chain_plugin`, `net_plugin`, `producer_plugin`, `resource_monitor_plugin`. Therefore, it is not necessary to load them again 

### `plugin` option

Plugins are essential for extending and modifying the functionality of a node. You use the `plugin` option to enable a given plugin within the running `nodeos` instance.

Option type | Config method | Syntax | Example
-|-|-|-
Nodeos-specific | CLI option | `--plugin arg` | `--plugin eosio::chain_plugin`
`nodeos` | `config.ini` | `plugin = arg` | `plugin = eosio::chain_plugin`

> ℹ️ `nodeos` plugins are not dynamically loaded. They are enabled when `nodeos` is launched and cannot be unloaded or reloaded while the `nodeos` instance is running. Plugins are baked into the `nodeos` binary.

### `enable-stale-production` option

You use the `enable-stale-production` option to enable block production, even if the chain is stale. Otherwise, if the chain were paused for an extended period of time, block production would fail.

Option type | Config method | Syntax | Example
-|-|-|-
Plugin-specific | CLI option | `-e` or `--enable-stale-production`
`producer_plugin` | `config.ini` | `enable-stale-production = true`

### `signature-provider` option

You use the `signature-provider` option to allow your node to sign blocks and transactions. The signature provider must be specified as a key pair.

Option type | Config method | Syntax | Example
-|-|-|-
Plugin-specific | CLI option | `-e` or `--enable-stale-production`
`producer_plugin` | `config.ini` | `enable-stale-production = true`

### `trace-no-abis` option

You use the `trace-no-abis` option to indicate that the RPC responses will not use ABIs. This option must be specified when the `trace-rpc-abi` option is not used to specify an ABI.

Option type | Config method | Syntax | Example
-|-|-|-
Plugin-specific | CLI option | `--trace-no-abis`
`trace_api_plugin` | `config.ini` | `trace-no-abis =`

### `access-control-allow-origin` option

Similar to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the web, the `access-control-allow-origin` option allows you to control access from other origins (domain, scheme, or port). For a development instance, you will most likely find it useful to allow all origins with the asterisk `*`, but then change it to specific origins for production.

Option type | Config method | Syntax | Example
-|-|-|-
Plugin-specific | CLI option | `--access-control-allow-origin arg`
`http_plugin` | `config.ini` | `access-control-allow-origin = arg`

## CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a protocol that enables scripts on a browser client to interact with resources from different origins. This is necessary because JavaScript is typically restricted by the same-origin policy, which limits its ability to make requests to URLs residing on different origins than the script's location. For instance, if a JavaScript application wants to make an AJAX call to an API hosted on a different domain, it would be blocked due to the same-origin policy.

> ℹ️ CORS is important for web decentralized applications (dApps) because without it, RPC API calls from a remote host to say an API node might be blocked.

### Why is CORS needed?

In most cases, a script running in the user's browser only needs to access resources within the same origin (such as making API calls to the backend that served the JavaScript code). Thus, the restriction preventing JavaScript from accessing resources on other origins is beneficial for security.

In this context, "other origins" refer to URLs that differ from the location where the JavaScript is running, with variations in the scheme (HTTP or HTTPS), domain, or port.

However, there are valid scenarios where cross-origin access is desired or even essential. For example, a React Single-Page Application (SPA) may need to communicate with an API backend hosted on a different domain. CORS is also crucial for the proper functioning of web fonts, for instance.

### Identifying a CORS Response

When a server is correctly configured to allow cross-origin resource sharing, specific headers are included in the response. These headers indicate the support for CORS and are used by web browsers to determine whether an `XMLHttpRequest` call should proceed or fail.

Several headers can be set, but the primary one that determines resource accessibility is `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. This header specifies the origins permitted to access the resource. For instance, to allow access from any origin, the header can be set as:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

Alternatively, it can be restricted to a specific origin:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://sample.io
```

> ℹ️ In the context of blockchain applications running as web dApps, `nodeos` provides the `access-control-allow-origin` option to control access from other origins. This option can be used by an EOS API node, for instance, to grant access to selected remote hosts.

## Summary

The `config.ini` file is responsible for configuring the functionality of a nodeos instance. It allows users to specify the nodes with which their node will establish connections, define the plugins to be utilized, and customize the behavior of the node through plugin-specific options. As a result, the config.ini file plays a significant role in determining how the node operates, and node operators frequently edit and personalize this file to assign specific roles to their nodes.
